## Introduction

**MAST** is a novel framework for **Arbitrary Style Transfer (AST)** that addresses a long-standing gap in **photorealistic style transfer**, while delivering competitive performance for **artistic styles**.  
It combines a Transformer-CNN hybrid architecture with three key innovations:

- **Multi-scale Adaptive Feature Adapter (MAFA)** — fuses multi-scale style features for fine-grained style-content decoupling.  
- **Domain-Enhanced Evaluator (DEE)** — enforces semantic- and domain-level alignment, reducing cross-domain artifacts.  
- **Weighted Style Contrastive Loss (WSCL)** — enables precise style matching with learnable contrastive modulation.
